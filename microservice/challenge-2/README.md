# Challenge 2 - Save the humans
Humanity is in danger !
The AI are unleashed and going crazy and they now can mimick real humans online.
But they have a flaw, they can't XXX

You are our savior. 
We beg you to build a learning system that will train on the dataset you will find in humanityorrobot.csv.
But please, make sure we can make it scale. The robot population is growing like ants!
As we will need to share this with the United States nation, please don't only build the system, but explain how it works 
and how we can reproduce your results!

Humanity will prevail!
