# Considerations

Some things i would improve about this code is the http calls, and the cache handling. I would certainly improve the overall design and make it responsive, but I just didn't have enought time. And write some unit testing. I know thats an important subject for you.

# Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. From the folder amaze-us/uiux/challenge-1/amaze-us run `ng serve`

**Voila!**
